\usage{
text_read(path = "", encoding = "UTF-8")

text_write(x = character(), path = "", encoding = "UTF-8")
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A non-empty and non-\link[base:NA]{NA} character string. A path to
a file to read text from, or write text to.}

\item{encoding}{A non-empty and non-\link[base:NA]{NA} character string. The
underlying source character encoding. In almost all cases, this should
be UTF-8. Other encodings are internally re-encoded to UTF-8 for
portability.}

\item{x}{A character vector. Lines of text to write. Its current encoding is
given by \code{encoding}.}
}
\value{
\code{\link[=text_read]{text_read()}} returns a character vector.

\code{\link[=text_write]{text_write()}} returns \code{NULL}, invisibly.
}
\description{
\code{\link[=text_read]{text_read()}} and \code{\link[=text_write]{text_write()}} respectively wrap \code{\link[base:readLines]{base::readLines()}} and
\code{\link[base:writeLines]{base::writeLines()}}. They further validate their arguments, normalize
file paths, and re-encode inputs to \code{UTF-8} before reading and writing.
}
\examples{
lines <- c(
  "Hello, world!",
  "These are lines to be written, and read afterwards.",
  "Bye!")

temp_file <- tempfile()

text_write(lines, temp_file)
text_read(temp_file)
