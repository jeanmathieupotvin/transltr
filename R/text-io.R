#' Low-level Text Input and Output
#'
#' [text_read()] and [text_write()] respectively wrap [base::readLines()] and
#' [base::writeLines()]. They further validate their arguments, normalize
#' file paths, and re-encode inputs to `UTF-8` before reading and writing.

#' @param x A character vector. Lines of text to write. Its current encoding is
#'   given by `encoding`.
#'
#' @returns
#' [text_read()] returns a character vector.
