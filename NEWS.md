# `transltr` 0.0.1.9001

This is the very first official development version of the package serving as
an inception point. As such, not all *new* features are listed below.

## New features

1. Many lower-level helper functions such as the `is_*()` and `assert_*()`
functions. They are not relevent for users but are super useful to developers.

2. A first Markdown template for so-called Translations Source Files (TSF).

3. A mechanism to efficiently convert TSF back to `R` objects.

4. Low-level S3 classes `Block`, `Location`, and `Token`.

5. Various placeholders for the future.

6. A lot of useful side scripts for developers.
