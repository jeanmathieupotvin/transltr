#' @param lang A non-empty and non-NA character string. The underlying language.
#'
#'   A language is usually a code (of two or three letters) for a native
#'   language name. While users retain full control over codes, it is best
#'   to use language codes stemming from well-known schemes such as
#'   [IETF BCP 47](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag), or
#'   [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes)
#'   to maximize portability and cross-compatibility.
