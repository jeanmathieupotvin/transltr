#' @param key A non-empty and non-[NA][base::NA] character string. A language
#'   key, i.e. a *code* for a language. For example, `"jp"` could be the key
#'   of `"日本語"` (Japanese). While users retain full control over keys, it is
#'   best to use language codes stemming from well-known schemes such as
#'   [IETF BCP 47](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag), and
#'   [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes).
#'   To maximize portability and to ease shared usage of language keys,
#'   [`transltr`][transltr] recommends using codes stemming from the former.
