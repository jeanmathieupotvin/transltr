#' Mock text file in foreign encoding
#'
#' This mock text file is used to test whether [read_text()] re-encodes
#' text input to `UTF-8` properly. It contains five Hiragana (japanese)
#' characters (a, i, u, e, o) and has a `EUC-JP` encoding. The latter is
#' convenient because it is ASCII-safe. Therefore, this header will never
#' generate an error and can be part of the file itself.
#'
#' @usage
#' ## Expected usage in tests/testthat/test-io-text.R
#' read_text(get_mock_path("text-io-eucjp", "txt"))
#'
#' @note
#' This header is included in the output of [read_text()]. Since it only
#' contains ASCII characters, it will always have a marked encoding equal
#' to `"unknown"` in R. This is because ASCII is pretty much universal and
#' cross-compatible with (almost) all known character encodings. As such,
#' it is as much `UTF-8` as it is `EUC-JP`.
