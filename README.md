An object model for source text and translations. Find and extract translatable
strings. Provide translations and seamlessly retrieve them at runtime.

## Introduction

R relies on GNU [`gettext`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) to produce
multi-lingual messages (if *Native Language Support* is enabled). This is
well-designed software offering an extensive set of functionalities. It is
ubiquitous and has withstood the test of time. It is not the objective of 
`transltr` to (fully) replace it.

Package `transltr` provides an alternative in-memory object model (and further
functions) to easily inspect and manipulate source text and translations.

&#x2705; It does not change any aspect of the underlying locale.

&#x2705; It has its own data serialization formats for I/O purposes. Source
text and translations can be exported to text formats that are sharable and
easily modifiable, even by non-technical collaborators.

&#x2705; Its features are extensively documented (even internal ones).

&#x2705; It can always locate and extract translatable strings (litteral
character vectors passed to `translate()`). They are treated as regular R
objects.

`translate()` works everywhere, including in calls to `stop()`, `warning()`,
and `message()`.

## Installation

Install the package from your preferred
[CRAN mirror](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).

```r
install.packages("transltr")
```

## Getting Started

Write code as you normally would. Whenever a piece of text (a literal character
vector) must be available in multiple languages, wrap it with `translate()`.

1. Once you are ready to work on translating your project, call `find_source()`.
   This returns a `Translator` object.

2. Export the `Translator` object with `translator_write()`. Fill in the
   underlying translation files.

3. Import translations back into an R session with `translator_read()`.

Current language and source language are respectively set with `language_set()`
and `language_source_get()`. By default, the latter is set equal to `"en"` 
(English).
